1. Activate your replay conda environment,
   and open this notebook in your favorite Jupyter Notebook editor or IDE.
1. Confirm you have installed all plugins used by the notebook,
   e.g. by running the 'import' cell, or with `conda list'
1. If you haven't, install them in the replay conda environment
   and restart the notebook kernel.
1. Search or scan visually for '<' or '>' characters to find places where
   user input (e.g. a filepath or column name) is required. If syntax
   highlighting is enabled, '<' and '>' will appear as syntax errors.

1. Remove all 'FIXME' comments from the notebook completely. Failure to do so
   may result in 'Missing Option' errors
1. Adjust the arguments to the commands below to suit your data and metadata.
   If your data is not identical to that in the replayed analysis,
   changes may be required. (e.g. sample ids or rarefaction depth)
1. Optional: search for 'SAVE' comments in the notebook, commenting out the
   `some_result.save` lines for any Results you do not want saved to disk.
1. Run this notebook as you would any other jupyter notebook.
